# Alien Ship vs Rocks - Game

## Overview

**Alien Ship vs Rocks** is an interactive space shooter game built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Players control a spaceship that must avoid falling rocks and shoot them to score points. The game is responsive, designed to be playable on both desktop and mobile devices.

## Features

* **Touch Controls**: The game is optimized for mobile play with touch controls for moving the ship and firing bullets.
* **Mouse Controls**: For desktop play, the game uses mouse movement to control the spaceship.
* **Responsive Design**: The canvas resizes dynamically to fit different screen sizes, ensuring the game looks great on any device.
* **Score Tracking**: The game tracks the player's score and displays it in real-time.
* **Game Over Screen**: When the player collides with a rock, the game ends, and the final score is displayed. Players can restart the game.

## Requirements

* A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, etc.)
* An internet connection to load the background image (if not available, a fallback color is used).

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   If you want to play the game locally, first clone this repository to your machine.

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/alien-ship-vs-rocks.git
   ```

2. **Open the game**:

## How to Play

* **Mobile**: Tap and drag on the screen to move the spaceship. The spaceship follows your touch position. The ship automatically fires bullets at regular intervals.
* **Desktop**: Move your mouse to control the spaceship. The ship follows the mouse cursor, and bullets are fired automatically.

## Game Mechanics

* **Spaceship**: The player controls a spaceship that can move around the screen. The spaceship is represented by a green triangle.
* **Rocks**: Rocks fall from the top of the screen at random positions and speeds. If a rock touches the spaceship, the game ends.
* **Bullets**: The spaceship automatically shoots bullets upwards. Bullets destroy rocks when they collide, adding points to the player's score.
* **Score**: Each rock destroyed earns points. Smaller rocks give 10 points, while larger rocks give 20 points.

## Controls

* **Touch/Mouse Movement**: Move the spaceship by dragging your finger (on mobile) or the mouse (on desktop).
* **Touch/Mouse Firing**: Bullets are fired automatically without any additional control required.

## Game Over

* The game ends when the spaceship collides with a falling rock. After the game ends, you can see your final score and restart the game.
* **High Score**: Your highest score is saved and displayed in the top-right corner.

## Game Development

This game was created using:

* **HTML5**: For the structure of the game.
